# C# Notes

## Introduction
These notes are intended for personal use.

I started learning C# in 2016, but in 2021, I endeavoured to produce a detailed set of notes based on the [official C# documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/whats-new/csharp-version-history "The history of C#") to solidify my understanding and as a reference to help in my future projects.

## Advanced C# Topics
These notes mainly cover the core C# features added as part of C# 1. For more advanced topics, I am working on [Advanced C# Notes](https://github.com/JACPro/Advanced-C-Sharp-Notes "JACPro Advanced C# Notes"); a study led by the book *C# in Depth* by Jon Skeet.
