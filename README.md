# C# Notes

## Introduction
I started C# in 2016, but recently committed to developing a more comprehensive understanding of the language. As part of my learning journey, I have endeavoured to produce a detailed set of notes based on the [official C# documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/whats-new/csharp-version-history "The history of C#") for 3 main purposes:
* To demonstrate my understanding
* As a reference guide for C# projects
* As a learning resource for others interested in learning C#

## Advanced C# Topics
These notes mainly cover the core C# features added as part of C# 1. For more advanced topics, I am working on [Advanced C# Notes](https://github.com/JACPro/Advanced-C-Sharp-Notes "JACPro Advanced C# Notes"); a study led by the book *C# in Depth* by Jon Skeet.
